# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
It is a Natural Language Processing Problem where Sentiment Analysis is done by Classifying the Positive tweets from negative tweets by machine learning model for text analysis, data analysis and data visualization.
# Introduction
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a hotbed of research in data science these days and one of the most common applications of NLP is sentiment analysis.It is used all over from opinion polls to creating entire marketing strategies.

Thousands of text documents can be processed for sentiment (and other features including named entities, topics, themes, etc.) in seconds, compared to the hours it would take a team of people to manually complete the same task.

We will do so by following a sequence of steps needed to solve a general sentiment analysis problem. We will start with cleaning of the raw text of the tweets. Then we will explore the cleaned text and try to get some intuition about the context of the tweets. After that, we will extract numerical features from the data and finally use these feature sets to train models and identify the sentiments of the tweets.

This is one of the most interesting challenges in NLP!
